Description: SPsimSeq uses a specially designed exponential family for density estimation 
              to constructs the distribution of gene expression levels from a given real 
              RNA sequencing data (single-cell or bulk), and subsequently simulates a new 
              dataset from the estimated marginal distributions using Gaussian-copulas to 
              retain the dependence between genes. It allows simulation of multiple groups 
              and batches with any required sample size and library size.
